## How do I make my site appear first in Google Search results?
Everyone asks us this question. The answer is: there is no secret, there are only good practices. Here are the best practices for improving your ranking in Google search results:

- **Provide high quality content on your site.** Google tries to find the best answer for our users’ requests; if you write the best material, you’re in the game. Use the [Search Analytics report](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/search-analytics) to see which queries lead to your pages, and what the click-through rate is for links to your site.

- **Make your site [mobile friendly](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/search-analytics).** Many users search on mobile devices; our search results favor pages that we think answer the user’s request best with the best possible user experience on their platform.

- **Use informative titles and snippets.** Good, clear titles and accurate meta tag descriptions help us understand the purpose of a page and generate useful snippets in our search results. [Learn more](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/35624).

- **Add structured data** to enable additional search result features such as stars, event information, or site search boxes, which add to the user experience, making your site more valuable to readers.

- **Make sure that you follow our guidelines** for good sites and avoid pitfalls that could affect your search ratings.
