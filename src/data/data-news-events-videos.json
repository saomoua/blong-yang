          "video-desc": "Blong Yang, a former recipient of county services, is running to lead that same system. More specifically, he is running to be the next Hennepin County Commissioner in District 2. His experience includes interning with Hennepin County in the Child Protection Services; working for Legal Aid Society of Minneapolis where he advocated for clients on the issues of language access and social services; running his own solo law practice for ten years; represented clients from being civilly committed through the Hennepin County Bar Association's Commitment Defense Panel; working for the City of Minneapolis as a civil rights investigator; and being on the Minneapolis City Council for four years (2014-2017). While on the Council, he chaired the Public Safety, Civil Rights, and Emergency Management Committee. He worked hard to increase the number of police, fire, and 911 staff, thus decreasing the response time. He secured funding for body cameras and implicit bias training. He spearheaded the Infill Housing Program to build new homes on 300 city-owned empty lots with $1.5 million for a pilot first year. He resurrected $1 Housing (Vacant Housing Recycling) Program which saved almost 100 houses from demolition and converted them into new rehabbed homes, putting them back on the tax rolls. Lastly, he brought in over $100 million in development to the Ward he represented; helped to create over 300 jobs, some of which went to Northsiders; and assisted the start-up of three brewery small businesses. His experiences on the City Council will be fully transferable to the Hennepin County Board. He is endorsed by the Minneapolis Fire Fighters Local 82 and the Hennepin County Sheriff's Deputies Association. Vote for Blong Yang for Hennepin County Commissioner on November 6, 2018."
