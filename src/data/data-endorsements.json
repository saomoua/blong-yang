We have known Blong for several years. We trust him to do the right thing. He will not be a candidate who makes promises that he does not keep. His experience, honesty and ability to look at issues from all sides will allow him to study any problems and concerns that affect the communities he represents. He is a listener and a problem solver who will work closely with the communities to find a solution to their concerns."

He has tirelessly stood up for the little guy and for what’s right, even when others may have been swayed by popular opinion. He has also stood up to extreme cultural pressure in pushing for LGBTQ and women’s rights in the Hmong community. Best of all, Blong is humble about all of this. You’ll never see him boast about all his accomplishments. But we guarantee you, anyone who has personally worked with Blong on an issue won’t stop talking about how good he is as a public servant. We’re excited to see what Blong can do as County Commissioner. We know he will work hard to get things done, improve efficiency, and increase accessibility to County services for all residents."
